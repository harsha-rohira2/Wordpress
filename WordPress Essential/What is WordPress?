## **The Difference Between WordPress.com and WordPress.org**

- **[WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com)**  
  WordPress.com is a hosted platform where your website is managed for you. It’s easier to start with but has some limitations on customization and control unless you pay for upgrades.

- **[WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org)**  
  WordPress.org is the self-hosted version. You download the software and install it on your own web hosting. It requires more setup and technical know-how but gives you full control over your site’s design, functionality, and data.
